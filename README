Color picker applet
====================

Concept

Button:

    * left click lets you pick a color from anywhere on the screen
    * middle click copies current color to clipboard
    * right click gives a menu to launch gcolor2, prefs etc..
        menu also holds previously selected colors, color sets (can be stored by name) etc..


The current state of the source is one of neglect. It is tested and actively
being used in Ubuntu 8.04. Not guaranteed to work anywhere else.
May be missing needed dependencies.
May hunt and feed on small pets.
